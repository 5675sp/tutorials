        <p>As Machine Learning (ML) continues to grow, more industries, from healthcare to banking, adopt machine learning models to generate predictions. These predictions are being used to justify the cost of healthcare and for loan approvals or denials. For regulated industries that are adopting machine learning, the <strong>interpretability</strong> of models is a requirement. In Machine Learning, <strong>interpretability</strong> can be defined as &#34;the ability to explain or present in understandable terms to a human [being].&#34;[1]</p>
<p>Few of the motivations for interpretability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better human understanding of impactful technologies</li>
<li>Regulation compliance and General Data Protection Regulations (GDPRs)</li>
<li>Check and balance against accidental or intentional discrimination</li>
<li>Hacking and adversarial attacks</li>
<li>Alignment with US FTC and OMB guidance on transparency and explainability</li>
<li>Prevent the building of excessive Machine Learning Technical Debt</li>
<li>More in-depth insight and understanding of your data</li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial, we will build a machine learning model using the famous <strong>Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset</strong>. We will use the dataset to build a classification model that will predict the probability of default payment by credit card clients using the data provided. In contrast to previous tutorials, we will focus on the most leading methods and concepts for explaining and interpreting Machine Learning models. Therefore, we will not focus so much on the experiment itself. Instead, we would shift our attention to how we can use the following metrics that a model generates (or we can generate) to truly understand our built model: results, graphs, scores, and reason code values. In particular, we will explore the following graphs in Driverless AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Shapley</li>
<li>Local Shapley</li>
<li>Transformed Shapley</li>
<li>Random Forest (RF) Feature Importance</li>
<li>Partial Dependence Plots</li>
<li>Decision Tree Surrogate</li>
<li>K-Lime</li>
<li>Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)</li>
<li>Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We recommend that you go over the entire tutorial first to review all the concepts; that way, you will be more familiar with the content once you start the experiment.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: Industry Context and ML Explainability Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Responsibility in AI and Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Explainability and interpretability in the machine learning space have grown tremendously since we first developed Driverless AI. With that in mind, it is important to frame the larger context in which our interpretability toolkit falls. It is worth noting that since this first training was developed, the push towards regulation, oversight, and auditing of ML models has increased. As a result, <strong>interpretability</strong>  has become a critical requirement for firms looking to make artificial intelligence a part of their operations. There have been many recent developments globally, which we have linked below, but the consistent themes are fairness, transparency, explainability, interpretability, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>As the field has evolved, many definitions and concepts have come into the mainstream; below, we outline H2O.ai&#39;s respective definitions &amp; understanding around the factors that make up Responsible Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="task-2-venn-diagram" src="img/d4fa66f14f4f9ff7.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explainable AI (XAI)</strong>: The ability to explain a model after it has been developed.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretable Machine Learning</strong>: Transparent model architectures and increasing how intuitive and understandable ML models can be.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical AI</strong>: Sociological fairness in machine learning predictions (i.e., whether one category of person is being weighted unequally).</li>
<li><strong>Secure AI</strong>: Debugging and deploying ML models with similar counter-measures against insider and cyber threats as seen in traditional software.</li>
<li><strong>Human-Centered ML</strong>: User interactions with AI and ML systems.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Whether that&#39;s with GDPR, CCPA, FCRA, ECOA, or other regulations, as an additional and crucial aspect of responsible AI.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Machine Learning Interpretability Taxonomy</h2>
<p>In machine learning models and results, interpretability has been defined as the ability to explain or present in understandable terms to a human [7]. Interpretability and explanations are subjective and complicated subjects. Therefore, the previously defined taxonomy has proven useful for characterizing interpretability in greater detail for various explanatory techniques [1].</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Response Function Complexity</h2>
<p>The more complex a function, the more difficult it is to explain. Simple functions can be used to explain more complex functions, and not all explanatory techniques are a good match for all types of models. Hence, it&#39;s convenient to have a classification system for response function complexity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear, monotonic functions</strong>: Response functions created by linear regression algorithms are probably the most popular, accountable, and transparent class of machine learning models. These models will be referred to here as linear and monotonic. They are transparent because changing any given input feature (or sometimes a combination or function of an input feature) changes the response function output at a defined rate, in only one direction. Monotonicity also enables accountability through intuitive and even automatic reasoning about predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Nonlinear, monotonic response functions</strong>: Although most ML response functions are nonlinear, some can be constrained to be monotonic for any given input feature.</li>
<li><strong>Nonlinear, monotonic response functions</strong> also enable accountability through the generation of both reason codes and feature importance measures. Moreover, nonlinear, monotonic response functions may even be suitable for use in regulated applications. Their output can change positively or negatively and at a varying rate for any change in an input feature.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Scope</h2>
<p>Traditional linear models are globally interpretable because they exhibit the same functional behavior throughout their entire domain and range. Machine learning models learn local patterns in training data and represent these patterns through complex behavior in learned response functions. Therefore, machine-learned response functions may not be globally interpretable, or global interpretations of machine-learned functions may be approximate. In many cases, local explanations for complex functions may be more accurate or simply more desirable due to their ability to describe single predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Global Interpretability</strong>: Some of the presented techniques facilitate global transparency in machine learning algorithms, their results, or the machine-learned relationship between the inputs and the target feature. Global interpretations help us understand the entire relationship modeled by the trained response function, but global interpretations can be approximate or be based on averages.</p>
<p><strong>Local Interpretability</strong>: Local interpretations promote understanding of small regions of the trained response function, such as clusters of input records and their corresponding predictions, deciles of predictions and their corresponding input observations, or even single predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Global Versus Local Analysis Motif</strong>: Driverless AI provides both global and local explanations for complex, nonlinear, non-monotonic machine learning models. Reasoning about the accountability and trustworthiness of such complex functions can be difficult, but comparing global versus local behavior is often a productive starting point.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Application Domain</h2>
<p>Another important way to classify interpretability techniques is to determine whether they are model-agnostic or model-specific.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model-agnostic:</strong> Meaning they can be applied to different types of machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Model-specific:</strong> Techniques that are only applicable for a single type of class of algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Driverless AI, decision tree surrogate, ICE, K-LIME, and Partial Dependence are all model-agnostic techniques, whereas Shapley, LOCO, and Random Forest Feature Importance are model-specific techniques.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Understanding and Trust</h2>
<p>Machine learning algorithms and the functions they create during training are sophisticated, intricate, and opaque. Humans who would like to use these models have basic, emotional needs to understand and trust them because we rely on them for our livelihoods or need them to make important decisions. The techniques in Driverless AI enhance understanding and transparency by providing specific insights into the mechanisms and results of the generated model and its predictions. The techniques described here enhance trust, accountability, and fairness by enabling users to compare model mechanisms and results to domain expertise or reasonable expectations by allowing users to observe or ensure the Driverless AI model&#39;s stability.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>The Multiplicity of Good Models</h2>
<p>It is well understood that complex machine learning algorithms can produce multiple accurate models for the same set of input features and prediction targets, but not the same internal architectures [6]. This alone is an obstacle to interpretation. This instability of not being able to reproduce internal architectures is a driving factor behind the presentation of multiple explanatory results in Driverless AI, enabling users to find explanatory information consistent across multiple modeling and interpretation techniques.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 3: Global Shapley Values and Feature Importance" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Global Shapley Values and Feature Importance Concepts</h2>
<p>Shapley values are one of the most powerful explainability metrics. Global Shapley values are the average of the local Shapley values over every row of a dataset. Feature importance measures the effect that a feature has on the predictions of a model. Global feature importance measures an input feature&#39;s overall impact on the Driverless AI model predictions while taking nonlinearity and interactions into consideration.</p>
<p>Note: Shapley Values</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Shapley values are used to define the importance of a single variable to a specific model versus the importance of that variable at the global level. Note, this is available for original features and transformed features in DAI.</p>
<p><strong>Business Case:</strong> In some models, we discover features are being overweighted versus their relative weighting at the global level.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Shapley and Feature Importance Plots</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the center of the MLI landing page, select <strong>Transformed Shapley</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="trasnformed-shapley" src="img/639abf074f2f11b2.jpg"></p>
<p>The plot above is a sample of a Shapley plot. Shapley is an &#34;old,&#34; very advanced tool, now being applied to machine learning. This plot shows the global importance value of the derived features. Notice the feature importance values are signed. The sign determines in which direction the values impact the model predictions on average. Shapley plots help by providing accurate and consistent variable importance even if data changes slightly.</p>
<p>Viewing the Global Shapley values plot is an excellent place to start because it provides a global view of feature importance, and we can see which features are driving the model from an overall perspective.</p>
<p>Derived features can be challenging to understand. For that reason, it also helps to look at this complex system from the space of the original inputs, and surrogate models allow us to do this.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on <strong>Surrogate Models:</strong>, then click <strong>Random Forest Feature Importance:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="rd-feature-importance" src="img/265c1481b6acbfda.jpg"></p>
<p>The <strong>Feature Importance</strong> plot, ranks the original features. These features are the original drivers of the model in the original feature space. These values were calculated by building  a <strong>Random Forest</strong> between the original features and the predictions of the complex driverless AI model that was just trained.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>View the <strong>Surrogate Model</strong>, <strong>Random Forest</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="rf-feature-importance-summary" src="img/265c1481b6acbfda.jpg"></p>
<p>This single <strong>Random Forest</strong> model of a complex Driverless AI model is very helpful because we can see that this is a trustworthy model between the original inputs to the system and the system&#39;s predictions. We assure the model&#39;s trustworthiness when we see the low mean squared error(0.0384) and high R2 (96%).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go back to the Shapley plot and find the feature importance of LIMIT_BAL. How important was LIMIT_BAL in the global feature importance space? Was LIMIT_BAL the main driver in this space?</li>
<li>Look for LIMIT_BAL in the <strong>Feature Importance</strong> under <strong>Surrogate Models</strong>. How important was LIMIT_BAL in the original feature importance space? Was LIMIT_BAL the main driver in this space?</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 4: Partial Dependence Plot" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Partial Dependence Concepts</h2>
<p>Partial dependence is a measure of the average model prediction with respect to an input variable. In other words, the average prediction of the model with respect to the values of a given variable. Partial dependence plots display how machine-learned response functions change based on the values of an input variable of interest while considering nonlinearity and averaging out the effects of all other input variables.</p>
<p>Partial dependence plots are well-known and described in the Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie et al., 2001). Partial dependence plots enable increased transparency in Driverless AI models and the ability to validate and debug Driverless AI models by comparing a variable&#39;s average predictions across its domain to known standards, domain knowledge, and reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Note: Partial Dependence Plot</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Partial Dependence Plots are used to show how much impact on the prediction a single variable has on average.</p>
<p><strong>Business Case:</strong>  Partial Dependence Plots can highlight on average how big of an impact a given variable has on the target column. For example, Partial Dependence Plots can help us see the average impact the Marital status variable has on the <strong>default.payment.next.month</strong> target column.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Partial Dependence Plot</h2>
<p>Through the <strong>Shapley Values</strong> and <strong>Feature Importance</strong>, we got a global perspective of the model. We will now explore the global behavior of the features concerning the model; this is done by using the Partial Dependency Plot.</p>
<p>1. Select <strong>Surrogate Models</strong>, <strong>Random Forest</strong> then <strong>Partial Dependecy Plot</strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="task-4-pdp" src="img/b2e1650353c384fa.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>These values of <strong>PAY_0</strong> represent the average predictions of all persons that paid on time or did not use their credit card.</li>
<li>This value represents the average prediction of persons who were late one month for <strong>PAY_0</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PAY_0 = 2</strong> has an average default probability of <strong>0.599</strong> approximately, and then the default probability slowly drops to month 8.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results indicate that overall, in the entire dataset, the worst thing for a person to be in regarding defaulting with respect to <strong>PAY_0</strong> is to be two months late. This behavior insight needs to be judged by the user, who can determine whether this model should be trusted.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 5: Decision Tree Surrogate" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Decision Tree Surrogate Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope of Interpretability:</strong> Generally, decision tree surrogates provide global interpretability. A decision tree&#39;s attributes are used to explain global attributes of a complex Driverless AI model, such as important features, interactions, and decision processes.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Response Function Complexity:</strong> Decision tree surrogate models can create explanations for models of nearly any complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding and Trust:</strong> Decision tree surrogate models foster understanding and transparency because they provide insight into complex models&#39; internal mechanisms. They enhance trust, accountability, and fairness when their important features, interactions, and decision paths align with human domain knowledge and reasonable expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Application Domain:</strong> Decision tree surrogate models are model agnostic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Decision Tree</h2>
<p>Now we are going to gain some insights into interactions. There are two ways in Driverless AI to do this; one of them is by making use of the <strong>Decision Tree</strong>. A <strong>Decision Tree</strong> is another surrogate model.</p>
<p>1. Select <strong>Surrogate Models</strong>,  then <strong>Decision Tree</strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="decision-tree-1" src="img/c22fb8e9a13a4064.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The RMSE value is low, and the R2 value is fairly high</li>
<li>The values at the top of the <strong>Decision Tree</strong> are higher importance variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Variables below one-another in the <strong>Decision Tree Surrogate</strong> may also have strong interactions in the Driverless AI model.</p>
<p>Based on the low RMSE and the fairly high R2, it can be concluded that this is a somewhat trustworthy surrogate model. This single decision tree provides an approximate overall flow chart of the complex model&#39;s behavior.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What are the most important variables in the <strong>Decision Tree</strong>? How do those variables compare to the previous plots we have analyzed?</li>
</ol>
<p>A potential interaction happens when a variable is below another variable in the decision tree. In the image below, a possible interaction is observed between variables <strong>PAY_0</strong> and <strong>PAY_2</strong>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="decision-tree-path" src="img/ae923451a6501d1d.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Potential interaction between <strong>PAY_0</strong> and <strong>PAY_2</strong>: this observation can be strengthened by looking at the Shapley Plot and locating any <strong>PAY_0</strong> and <strong>PAY_2</strong> interactions.</li>
<li>The thickness of the yellow line indicates that this is the most common path through the decision tree. This path is the lowest probability of default leaf node.</li>
<li>Variables in a Decision Tree connected by a line might suggest a possible connection that impacts predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be observed from the <strong>Decision Tree</strong> that most people tend to pay their bills on time based on the thickness of the path highlighted with green arrows. The people in the highlighted path are those with the lowest default probability. This low default probability path on the <strong>Decision Tree</strong> is an approximation to how the complex model would place people in a low default probability &#34;bucket.&#34;</p>
<p>The path to a low default probability can be confirmed by looking at the <strong>Partial Dependency</strong> plots for both <strong>PAY_0</strong> and <strong>PAY_2</strong> from earlier. Both plots confirm the low default probability before month two.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="task-4-pdp" src="img/b2e1650353c384fa.jpg"></p>
<p>It is important to note that what we are confirming is not whether the model&#39;s results are &#34;correct&#34; rather how the model is behaving. The model needs to be analyzed, and decisions need to be made about whether or not the model&#39;s behavior is correct.</p>
<p>Task 5 summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examined how the variables interacted through the <strong>Decision Tree</strong>.</li>
<li>Observed the average behavior with respect to the model prediction by examining the partial dependence.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 6: K-LIME" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>K-LIME Concepts</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> LIME is an explainability method that makes minor adjustments to the data sample to see how it impacts the predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Business Case:</strong> LIME enables data scientists to understand how sensitive their model is to changes in the data set or sample.</p>
<p>K-LIME is a variant of the LIME technique. K-LIME generates global and local explanations that increase the Driverless AI model&#39;s transparency and allow model behavior to be validated and debugged by analyzing the provided plots. The generated explanations also allow for a comparison between global and local explanations to one another, to known standards, domain knowledge, and reasonable expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope of Interpretability:</strong> K-LIME provides several different scales of interpretability:  <ul>
<li>(1) coefficients of the global GLM surrogate give information on 				 global and average trends,</li>
<li>(2) coefficients of in-segment GLM surrogates display average 		 trends in local regions, and</li>
<li>(3) when evaluated for specific in-segment observations, K-LIME 				provides reason codes on a pre-observation basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Response Function Complexity:</strong>  <ul>
<li>(1) K-LIME can create explanations for machine learning models of high complexity.</li>
<li>(2) K-LIME accuracy can decrease when the Driverless AI model becomes too nonlinear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understanding and Trust:</strong>  <ul>
<li>(1) K-LIME increases transparency by revealing important input features and their linear trends.</li>
<li>(2) K-LIME enhances accountability by creating explanations for each observation in a dataset.</li>
<li>(3) K-LIME bolsters trust and fairness when the important features and their linear trends around specific records conform to human domain knowledge and reasonable expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application Domain: K-LIME is model agnostic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>K-LIME Plot</h2>
<p>The recent tasks have focused on the model&#39;s global behavior for the entire dataset, but how does the model behave for a single person? A great but complex tool for this is K-Lime.</p>
<p>1. Under <strong>Surrogate Models</strong> select <strong>K-LIME</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="klime-1" src="img/e1b3ab652f12791e.jpg"></p>
<p>2. On the green highlighted area of the K-LIME Plot, click on <strong>Model Prediction</strong>, <strong>LIME Model Prediction</strong>, then <strong>Actual Target</strong>. The K-LIME plot should look similar to the image below:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="empty-klime" src="img/8821701d80ae5160.jpg"></p>
<p>3. On the green highlighted area of the K-LIME Plot, click on <strong>Model Prediction</strong>, <strong>LIME Model Prediction</strong>, then <strong>Actual Target</strong>. The K-LIME plot should look similar to the image below:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="klime-low-and-high-predict" src="img/bbc20ae2fa52806d.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to note</em>:</p>
<p>This plot is the predictions of the Driverless AI model from lowest to highest. The x-axis is the index of the rows that causes that ranking to occur from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>4. Add <strong>Actual Target</strong> by clicking on it, and the plot should look similar to the one below:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="klime-targets" src="img/1be16a3dcd38e232.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>People who did not pay their bills on time.</li>
<li>People who paid their bills on time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding the <strong>Actual Target</strong> to the plot allows us to check if the model is not entirely wrong. The plot&#39;s density (2: bottom left) near the low ranked predictions show that many people made their payments on time while those in line (1: top left) had missed payments since the line is scattered. Towards the high ranked predictions, the density of line (1: top right) shows the high likelihood of missing payments while the sparseness of line (2: botto right) shows those who have stopped making payments. These observations are a good sanity check.</p>
<p>5. Now, click on <strong>LIME Model Prediction</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="klime-1" src="img/e1b3ab652f12791e.jpg"><img alt="global-interpretable" src="img/457bd8770fe369dd.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The global interpretable model explains 89.39% in default payment next month for the entire dataset with RMSE = 0.065.</li>
</ol>
<p>This single linear model trained on the original input of the system to predict the original Driverless AI model&#39;s predictions shows that the original model predictions are highly linear. The plot above is an implementation of LIME or &#34;Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations,&#34; wherein we aim to fit a simple linear model to a more complex machine learning model.</p>
<p><strong>K-LIME Advance Features</strong></p>
<p>6. On the K-LIME plot, change the Cluster to Cluster 13.</p>
<p>7. Select another high probability default person from this K-LIME cluster by clicking on one of the white points on the plot&#39;s top-right section.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="klime-advance.jpg" src="img/3fcba0cfc661ad77.jpg"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change cluster to cluster 13 and note the R2 value is still very high.</li>
<li>Pick a point on the top-right section of the plot and Examine the Reason Codes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The local model predictions (white points) can be used to reason through the Driverless AI model (yellow) in some local regions.</p>
<p>8. Review <strong>Explanations</strong> on the <strong>K-LIME</strong> plot:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="reason-codes" src="img/b5841e96110b74c8.jpg"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="reason-codes-cluster-13" src="img/8ed00084b791a70d.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The reason codes show that the Driverless model prediction gave this person a .78 percent probability of default. LIME gave them a .82 percent probability of default, and in this case, we can say that LIME is 95.1% accurate. Based on this observation, it can be concluded that the local reason codes are fairly trustworthy. Suppose <strong>Lime Prediction Accuracy</strong> drops below 75%. In that case, we can say that the numbers are probably untrustworthy, and the Shapley plot or LOCO plot should be revisited since the Shapley values are always accurate, and LOCO accounts for nonlinearity and interactions.</li>
<li><strong>PAY_0 = 2</strong> months late is the top positive local attribute for this person and contributes .35 probability points to their prediction according to this linear model. 0.35 is the local linear model coefficient for level 3 of the categorical variable PAY_0.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 13</strong> reason codes show the average linear trends in the data region around this person.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Global reason codes show the average linear trends in the dataset as a whole.</p>
<p>In conclusion, LIME values are an approximate estimate of the trend of how the model is behaving in a local region for a specific point. Further, reason codes help us describe why the model made its decision for this specific person. Reason codes are essential in highly regulated industries when regulators will want to see in simple terms &#34;how did the model come to the conclusion it did.&#34;</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 7: Local Shapley and LOCO" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Local Shapley Concepts</h2>
<p>Shapley explanations are a technique with credible theoretical support that presents consistent global and local variable contributions. Local numeric Shapley values are calculated by repeatedly tracing single rows of data through a trained tree ensemble and aggregating each input variable&#39;s contribution as the row of data moves through the trained ensemble.</p>
<p>Shapley values sum to the Driverless AI model&#39;s prediction before applying the link function, or any regression transforms. (Global Shapley values are the average of the local Shapley values over every row of a data set.)</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>LOCO Concepts</h2>
<p>Local feature importance describes how combining the learned model rules or parameters and an individual row&#39;s attributes affect a model&#39;s prediction for that row while taking nonlinearity and interactions into effect. Local feature importance values reported here are based on a variant of the leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) method (Lei et al., 2017).</p>
<p>In the LOCO-variant method, each local feature importance is found by re-scoring the trained Driverless AI model for each feature in the row of interest while removing the contribution to splitting the model prediction rules that contain that feature throughout the ensemble. The original prediction is then subtracted from this modified prediction to find the raw, signed importance for the feature. All local feature importance values for the row can be scaled between 0 and 1 for direct comparison with global feature importance values.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Local Shapley Plot</h2>
<p>Local Shapley Plots can generate variable contribution values for every row that the model predicts. In other words, we can generate for every person in our dataset the exact numeric contribution of each of the variables for each prediction of the model. For the <strong>Local Shapley</strong> plots, the yellow bars stay the same since they contribute to the global variable. However, the grey bars will change when a different row or person is selected from the dataset using the <strong>row selection dialog box</strong> or by clicking on an individual in the K-LIME plot.</p>
<p>The grey bars or local numeric contributions can be used to generate reason codes. The reason codes should be suitable for regulated industries where modeling decisions need to be justified. For our dataset, we can select a person with a high default probability, select Shapley Local plot, and pick out the largest grey bars as the most significant contributors for the decision of denying a future loan.</p>
<p>1. Select a high probability default person on the K-LIME plot by clicking on one of the white points in the plot&#39;s top-right corner.</p>
<p>2. Then under the <strong>Driverless AI Model</strong>, select <strong>Shapley</strong>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="transformed-shapley-row-11427.jpg" src="img/3af2ab93d3c9c9e5.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Shapley plot will depend on the K-LIME point you selected.</p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Row number being observed</li>
<li>Global Shapley value</li>
<li>A sample of a Shapley Local numeric contribution of a variable for the high probability person in row 11427</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Pick another high probability person on the <strong>K-LIME</strong> plot and return to the <strong>Shapley</strong> plot and determine what local Shapley values have influenced the person you selected from defaulting (look for the largest grey bars)?</p>
<p>4. How do those Shapley local values compare to their perspective Shapley Global values? Are the local Shapley values leaning towards defaulting even though the Shapley global values are leaning towards not defaulting? How do the local Shapley values compare to the local K-LIME values?</p>
<p>In conclusion, Shapley&#39;s local variables are locally accurate and globally consistent. If the dataset changes slightly, the variable importance can be expected to not reshuffle. Shapley local values should be good enough to create reason codes. Shapley values operate on the trained model itself and are more exact than surrogate models, which are more approximate.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 8: Putting it All Together and ICE" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>The ICE Technique</h2>
<p>Individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, a newer and less well-known adaptation of partial dependence plots, can be used to create more localized explanations for a single individual using the same basic ideas as partial dependence plots. ICE Plots were described by Goldstein et al. (2015). ICE values are simply disaggregated partial dependence, but ICE is also a type of nonlinear sensitivity analysis in which the model predictions for a single row are measured. At the same time, a variable of interest is varied over its domain. ICE plots enable a user to determine whether the model&#39;s treatment of an individual row of data is outside one standard deviation from the average model behavior.</p>
<p>1. Select <strong>Dashboard</strong>:</p>
<p>ICE is simply predicting the model for the person in question, in our case, row 11427. The data for this row was fixed except for PAY_0, and then it was cycled through different pay values. The plot above is the result of this cycling. Suppose the ICE values (grey dots) diverge from the partial dependence (yellow dots). In other words, if ICE values are going up and partial dependence is going down. This behavior can be indicative of an interaction. This is because the individual behavior (grey dots) is different since it is diverging from the average behavior.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dashboard-11427" src="img/b1ee8577572b85fd.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to note:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ICE (grey dots)</li>
<li>Partial Dependence (yellow dots) and LOCO feature Importance for the person in row 11427 (grey bars) in relation to global feature importance.</li>
<li>Decision Tree Path for the person in row 11427.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can observe divergence on the ICE plot and confirm possible interactions with the decision tree surrogate(the grey path). Note a possible interactions between PAY_0, PAY_6, and PAY_2.</p>
