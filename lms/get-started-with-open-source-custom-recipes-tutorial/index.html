        <p>At H2O.ai, we believe that every company can and should be an AI company. This is a fundamental concept for the future of every business and organization today. As you embark on this AI journey to make your own AI, we want you to explore the key considerations as well as the technology that will make your own AI a possibility.</p>
<p>To make your own AI with an automatic machine learning platform, the platform needs to be open and extensible. This allows data scientists to influence the automatic machine learning optimization process and for the process to consider additional feature engineering, scorers metrics, and modeling algorithms. Data scientists can add their insights, customizations, and domain expertise to build the most accurate models for each use case. Driverless AI uses the concept of recipes to optimize the machine learning process, and with Driverless AI 1.7.0 and later versions, users can add and develop custom recipes.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will cover what a recipe is, the different types of recipes available, and how to upload existing recipes to Driverless AI through the URL option. The three types of custom recipes that will be covered are transformer, scorer, and model.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 1: Introduction to Driverless AI Bring Your Own Recipe" duration="0">
        <p>H2O Driverless AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform for automatic machine learning. Driverless AI automates some of the most difficult and tedious data science and machine learning tasks such as feature engineering, algorithm selection, model validation, model tuning, model selection, model explanation, model documentation, and model deployment. It aims to achieve the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to expert data scientists, but in a much shorter time thanks to end-to-end automation. The current scope of Driverless AI does not include extensive data manipulation or augmentation before starting an experiment; hence most of the data preparation needs to be done before loading the data.</p>
<p>Driverless AI uses an experiment to learn from your data and build an end-to-end scoring pipeline for productionalizing a model. The experiment process and the final pipeline are made up of building blocks, or recipes. These recipes are Python code snippets. Recipes have the following types: ML algorithms, feature engineering (transformers), scorers, and data. In Driverless AI 1.7.0, we added support for BYOR (Bring Your Own Recipe). With BYOR, you can use your own recipes in combination with or instead of all built-in recipes. This allows you to further influence the Driverless AI Automatic ML pipeline in addition to out-of-the-box control over the optimization choices that Driverless AI makes.</p>
<p>Recipes can be uploaded into Driverless AI at runtime without having to restart the platform, just like a plugin. There are approximately 150 open-source recipes that have been created by H2O and curated in the recipe library by data science experts that can be used as-is or as templates and expanded upon.</p>
<p>Existing recipes include templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transformers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scorers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Models</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The various types of templates and how to use them will be described in the remaining tasks of the tutorial. Please note that the <strong>Data</strong> recipes will be covered in another tutorial.</p>
<h2>How do recipes work in Driverless AI?</h2>
<p>During the training of a supervised machine learning modeling pipeline, Driverless AI can use the custom recipes or code snippets as building blocks, independent or in combination with all built-in recipes that come with Driverless AI. The custom recipes act the same as if they were written by H2O.ai. It&#39;s the same python template and backend, so there is no performance penalty.</p>
<p>Below is a diagram of how recipes work in Driverless AI and how the Automatic Model Optimization process is extended:</p>
<p><img alt="dai-byor-how-it-works" src="img/19c0e46d6cf96f0d.jpg"></p>
<p>The image below is a deeper dive into the <strong>BYOR</strong> architecture for a multi-class problem:</p>
<p><img alt="dai-byor-architecture-diagram-1" src="img/eed8ff3f17393b90.jpg"></p>
<p>The diagram above focuses on the parts of Driverless AI that are relevant to the <strong>BYOR</strong> architecture. Automatic Visualization and Machine Learning Interpretability are not covered in this diagram. The diagram is the architecture representing a multi-class problem. Binary classification and regression problems are also supported.</p>
<h2>What is the role of recipes in ML?</h2>
<p><strong>BYOR</strong> allows Data Scientists to bring their own recipes or leverage the existing, open-source recipes to manipulate, augment, and optimize their data. In this way, the expertise of those creating and using the recipes is leveraged to focus on domain-specific functions to build customizations.</p>
<h2>Where can you find the H2O open-source recipes?</h2>
<p>The curated open-source recipes currently reside in the following GitHub repository:</p>

<li><strong>Churn</strong> - Did customer churn? True.: customer churned, False.: customer did not churn</li>
</ol>
<p>9.  Return to the <strong>Datasets</strong> Page</p>
<h2>Launch Experiment</h2>
<p>1. On the <strong>Datasets</strong> page click on the <code>churn.csv</code> dataset and select <strong>Predict</strong></p>
<p><img alt="churn-predict" src="img/e6857098f6b3bf1b.jpg"></p>
<p>2.  Select <strong>Not Now</strong> on the <strong>First time Driverless AI</strong> box message. A similar image should appear:</p>
<p><img alt="churn-experiment" src="img/26f1422f5086cf0a.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Target Column</strong>, then select <strong>Churn?</strong></p>
<p><img alt="select-churn" src="img/602dda83389cbcf8.jpg"></p>
<p>4. Name your experiment <code>Exp 1 - Baseline</code> and verify that the experiment looks similar to the one below, then select <strong>Launch Experiment</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You might have to update the default settings to the ones shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="exp1-settings" src="img/873502ed84455807.jpg"></p>
<p>5. Once the experiment is completed, a similar page will appear with experiment results:</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 1 Results:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="exp1-summary" src="img/e53f7c02ad330714.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Experiment 1 - ROC Accuracy</strong></p>
<p><img alt="exp1-accuracy" src="img/3046a979701d185.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Things to Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Under summary</strong>: The validation score is 0.9080 with a best accuracy of 0.9286 (click on ROC then hover over Best ACC)</li>
<li><strong>Variable Importance</strong>: The top variable that led to a customer churning according to this model was &#34;CustServ Calls.&#34; The other variable of most importance is &#34;Day_charge&#34;. Intuitively this makes sense because if a customer is overpaying for calls in the morning when they might be the most active and also overpaying for &#34;CustServ Calls&#34;, it could have led to a dissatisfied customer.</li>

<p>When a dataset is selected for an experiment, Driverless AI optimizes its settings by selecting the best Scorer, Model(s), and Transformers for the dataset. However, this does not mean we cannot import other scorers, models, or transformers to see if we can further optimize our model. In this task, we will be importing a transformer recipe, to see how the features in the feature engineering change.</p>
<p>Now we are going to import a recipe to add together related numeric features such as day minutes, evening minutes, and night minutes. Driverless AI doesn&#39;t add three or more columns automatically, so we will add a recipe that will do this for us. We will see if this new feature ends up in the top features used by our final Driverless AI model.</p>
<h2>Import a Transformer Recipe</h2>
<p>The goal of importing the new transformer recipe is to see if we can further optimize our baseline model. To do this, we are going to take our baseline experiment and import the <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/driverlessai-recipes/blob/rel-1.9.0/transformers/numeric/sum.py" target="_blank">sum.py transformer</a></p>
<p>1. Select <strong>Experiments</strong> located at the top of the <strong>Experiment</strong> page:</p>

<p>2. Hover over <strong>Exp 1 - Baseline</strong>, then click on the three stacked small boxes located on the right side of <strong>Exp 1 - Baseline</strong> and select <strong>New Model with Same Params</strong>, this will create a new experiment with the same parameters that you used for <strong>Exp 1 - Baseline</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="exp2-new-model-w-same-params" src="img/d7b6b73706d97ff1.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Not Now</strong> on the <strong>First Time Using Driverless AI Tour</strong></p>

<p><img alt="exp2-load-custom-recipe-transformer" src="img/95cec4bc40cc2c8a.jpg"></p>
<p>6. Copy and paste  the following URL for the SumTransformer into the <strong>Load Custom Recipe</strong> box then click on <strong>Save.</strong></p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/h2oai/driverlessai-recipes/blob/rel-1.9.0/transformers/numeric/sum.py
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="exp2-load-custom-recipe-transformer-raw-url" src="img/7a62c300bf569fbb.jpg"></p>
<p>7. There will be a message updating you on the status of loading the recipe; then the Expert Experiment Settings page will re-appear</p>
<p>8. On the <strong>Expert Experiment Settings</strong> find <strong>Recipes</strong> and click on it</p>
<p><img alt="exp2-expert-settings-recipes" src="img/d9292691426855a7.jpg"></p>
<p>9. Click on <strong>Select Values</strong> under <strong>Include Specific Transformer</strong>, we are going to verify that the transformer we loaded did indeed load.</p>
<p><img alt="exp2-expert-settings-transformer-select-values" src="img/386a4b10f8a6b356.jpg"></p>
<p>10. Type <code>SumTransformer</code> on the search bar, if the Transformer loaded correctly, then it will appear as shown below, highlighted, meaning that it will be used by Driverless AI. Make sure your <strong>SumTransformer</strong> is checked, and click <strong>Done</strong></p>
<p><img alt="exp2-sum-transformer" src="img/b64973c1ac07cdea.jpg"></p>
<p>11. Select <strong>Save</strong> on the <strong>Expert Experiment Settings</strong> page</p>
<p>12. Name your experiment <code>Exp 2 - Transformer</code>. Also, verify that the transformer is in the experiment; on the Experiments page, look under &#34;What do these settings mean?&#34; &gt; &#34;Interpretability&#34; and you should see the custom transformer as <strong>Sum.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="exp2-check-transformer" src="img/7154283a919fa029.jpg"></p>
<p>13. Select <strong>Launch Experiment</strong></p>
<p><img alt="exp2-summary" src="img/cf874279c2d7c227.jpg"></p>
<p>Note: In Variable Importance: It might be the case that in your experiment  certain features will start with &#34;SUM;&#34; those are the features from the custom transformer. If so, that will mean that they are playing an important role in the new model.</p>
<p>In this case, the AUC didn&#39;t improve, and that is because Driverless AI didn&#39;t use the recipe we uploaded. Though sometimes, Driverless AI makes use of the transformer, and that depends on the Data sampling it uses when running the experiment.  If you want to see how the recipe will improve the AUC, you can go back to recipes and only select the transformer. We will further discuss the results at the end of task 6.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 6: Comparing Final Model Results" duration="0">
        <p>So far, we ran four experiments, a baseline, and the baseline with three different types of recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driverless AI default settings</li>
<li>Transformer</li>
<li>Scorer</li>
<li>Model</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are going to compare the results of all the experiments through the <strong>Projects</strong> feature which allows us to compare the final models for each experiment:</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Projects</strong></p>
<p><img alt="projects-select" src="img/2e0bad92168a4a12.jpg"></p>
<p>2. Select <strong>+New Project</strong></p>
<p>3. Enter the following under:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p><i>Customer Churn Recipe Comparison</p></i>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p><i>Comparison of customer churn experiments using various recipes.</p></i>
<p>4. Select <strong>Create a New Project</strong></p>
<p><img alt="create-project" src="img/f91502496157d58d.jpg"></p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>+Link Experiment</strong></p>
<p><img alt="projects-link-experiment" src="img/ecf32bfab71054f1.jpg"></p>
<p>6. Select <strong>Exp 1 - Baseline</strong> by clicking on the Model</p>
<p><img alt="project-select-exp1" src="img/199ec13b3dc6cae5.jpg"></p>
<p>7. Repeat step 6 for the remaining models (2, 3, and 4). The <strong>Project</strong> page should look similar to the one below:</p>
<p><img alt="projects-all-models-selected" src="img/d8c5b9caa7f27b34.jpg"></p>
<p>8. Select Exp 1, 2 and 3 to compare by clicking on the select box to the left of each model, and then on <strong>Compare 3 Items</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="project-select-models-to-compare" src="img/6cc7c30030f300f9.jpg"></p>
<p>9. A similar page will appear with the three model results:</p>
<p><img alt="project-model-comparison1" src="img/21caf92f7867acca.jpg"></p>
<p>Confusion Matrices for each of the selected models</p>
<p><img alt="project-model-comparison-matrix" src="img/40d2f1c004a38d47.jpg"></p>
<p>From the confusion matrices shown above, we can get an idea of how the models with the custom recipes improved. We can see that the Scorer recipe yielded a lower misclassification error compared to the baseline misclassification error of 7.56% .</p>
<ul>
<li>Formula: Misclassification (all <strong>incorrect</strong> / all) = (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)</li>
<li>The misclassification percentage for the Scorer recipe is:</li>
</ul>
<p>Misclassification = (133 + 103) / (2717 + 380 + 133 + 103)</p>
<p>Misclassification = 236 / 3,333 = 0.0708 = <strong>7.08%</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The misclassification percentage for the Baseline is:</li>
</ul>
<p>Misclassification = (146 + 106) / (377 + 2704 + 106 + 146)</p>
<p>Misclassification = 252 / 3,333 = 0.0756 = <strong>7.56%</strong></p>
<p>However, since we were working with a slightly imbalanced dataset, we need to take a closer look at the confusion matrices. We see that by using the custom recipes, the models started predicting more <strong>False</strong> labels correctly, in other words, we see more <strong>True Negatives;</strong> thus, we have a smaller misclassification error for the <strong>False</strong> class. On the other hand, only the Scorer recipe helped our model to predict more <strong>True</strong> labels correctly because, for the Transformer recipe, it was the opposite. The Scorer recipe helped the model get more <strong>True Positives</strong> than the baseline model, while the Transformer recipe got less <strong>True Positives</strong> than the baseline model.  For that reason, we see that the misclassification error for the True label only improved for the model with the Scorer recipe. Though this can change if we in particular make Driverless AI only use the transformer recipe on experiment 2.</p>
<p>ROC Curves for each model selected:</p>
<p><img alt="project-model-comparison2" src="img/637bc2be28d590fa.jpg"></p>
<p>We can see that when we used the Scorer recipe, the model had better AUC with an accuracy of 0.9125 compared to Exp 1 - Baseline, which had an accuracy of 0.9080. Though in Exp 2 - Transformer, the AUC didn&#39;t improve, and therefore, there was a small decrease in the AUC. Also, when looking at the variable importance, we see a slight variation on the variables that have the largest contribution to customers churning. In Exp 1 - Baseline, the variables with most importance when it came to customers churning were &#34;CustServ Calls,&#34; and &#34;Day Charge.&#34; Exp 2, where we used the Transformer to sum columns with similar numerical data, we have the most important variable &#34;CustServ Calls&#34; and &#34;sum of CustServ Calls.&#34;</p>
