## Objective 


Image processing techniques have become crucial for a diverse range of companies despite their operations in the course of time. In other words, to compete in this global economy, image processing is becoming a requirement for any company hoping to become a credible competitor. Everyone can now see image processing in Agricultural Landscape, Disaster Management, and Biomedical and Other Healthcare Applications. 
With this in mind, and with the hopes to democratize AI, H2O.ai has automated the processes of obtaining high-quality models capable of image processing. 

This tutorial will explore the two different approaches to modeling images in Driverless AI: Embeddings Transformer(Image Vectorizer) and Automatic Image Model. To illustrate the first image modeling approach, we will build an image model to predict a car's price. Right after, we will better understand the second approach by building an image model capable of predicting a true case of metastatic cancer.  In the final analysis, we will compare and contrast each image modeling approach, and we will discuss several scenarios when a given approach will be better.

All things consider, let us start.
