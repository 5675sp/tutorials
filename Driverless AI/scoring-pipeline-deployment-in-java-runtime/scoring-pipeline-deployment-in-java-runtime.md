## Objective

**Machine Learning Model Deployment** is the process of making your model available in production environments, so they can be used to make predictions for other software systems [1]. Before model deployment, **feature engineering** occurs in the form of preparing data that later on will be used to train a model [2]. Driverless AI **Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)** combines the best feature engineering and one or more **machine learning models** into a scoring pipeline [3][4]. The **scoring pipeline** is used to score or predict data when given new test data [5]. The **scoring pipeline** comes in two flavors. The first scoring pipeline is a **Model Object, Optimized(MOJO) Scoring Pipeline**, which is a standalone, low-latency model object designed to be easily embeddable in production environments. The second scoring pipeline is a Python Scoring Pipeline, which has a heavy footprint that is all Python and uses the latest libraries of Driverless AI to allow for executing custom scoring recipes[6].

By the end of this tutorial, you will predict the **cooling condition** for a **Hydraulic System Test Rig** by deploying an **embeddable MOJO Scoring Pipeline** into **Java Runtime** using **Java**, **Sparkling Water**, and **PySparkling**. The Hydraulic System Test Rig data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems#). Hydraulic System Test Rigs are used to test components in Aircraft Equipment, Ministry of Defense, Automotive Applications, and more [7]. This Hydraulic Test Rig is capable of testing a range of flow rates that can achieve different pressures with the ability to heat and cool to simulate testing under different conditions [8]. Testing the pressure, volume flow, and temperature is possible by Hydraulic Test Rig sensors and digital displays. The display panel alerts the user when a criterion is met, displaying either a green or red light[8]. A filter blockage panel indicator is integrated into the panel to ensure the Hydraulic Test Rig’s oil is maintained [8]. The cooling filtration solution is designed to minimize power consumption and expand the life of the Hydraulic Test Rig. We are predicting cooling conditions for Hydraulic System Predictive Maintenance. When the cooling condition is low, our prediction tells us that the cooling of the Hydraulic System is close to total failure and we may need to look into replacing the cooling filtration solution soon.

The Hydraulic Test Rig consists of a primary and secondary cooling filtration circuit with pumps that deliver flow and pressure to the oil tank. The oil tank box at the bottom. There is a pressure relief control valve for controlling the rising and falling flows. There is a pressure gauge for measuring the pressure.

## Task 2: Deploy Scoring Pipeline in Java Runtime Concepts

### MOJO Scoring Pipeline Files

After downloading the MOJO scoring pipeline, the **mojo-pipeline** folder comes with many files. The files that are needed to execute the MOJO scoring pipeline include **pipeline.mojo**, **mojo2-runtime.jar**, **example.csv**. The file that helps with running the pipeline quickly includes **run_example.sh**. The **pipeline.mojo** is the standalone scoring pipeline in MOJO format. This pipeline file contains the packaged feature engineering pipeline and the machine learning model. The **mojo2-runtime.jar** is the MOJO Java API. The **example.csv** contains sample test data. 

### Embedding the MOJO into the Java Runtime

If you have gone through the earlier scoring pipeline deployment tutorials, you have seen the way we deploy the MOJO Scoring Pipeline is to a server or serverless instance and there is some client that interacts with the server to trigger it to execute the MOJO to make predictions. An alternative way to deploy the MOJO Scoring Pipeline is to embed it directly into the Java Runtime Environment where your application is running. So if you are building a Java application using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor, you can import the MOJO Java API, then use it to load the MOJO, put your test data into a MOJO frame, then perform predictions on the data and return the results.

## Task 3: Batch Scoring

You will execute the MOJO scoring pipeline in the Java Runtime Environment using Java, PySparkling, and Sparkling Water.

### Batch Scoring via Run ExecuteMojo Java Example

You will run the **run_example.sh** script that came with the mojo-pipeline folder. This script requires the mojo file, csv file and license file. It runs the Java **ExecuteMojo** example program and the mojo makes predictions for a batch of Hydraulic cooling condition.

Since we already have our license file path specified as an environment variable, we will pass in the path to the mojo file and example csv data to the **run_example.sh** and then run it:

```java
cd $HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/
bash run_example.sh pipeline.mojo example.csv
```

![batch-scoring-via-shell-script-1](assets/batch-scoring-via-shell-script-1.jpg)

![batch-scoring-via-shell-script-2](assets/batch-scoring-via-shell-script-2.jpg)


This classification output is the batch scoring done for our Hydraulic System cooling condition. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency and 100 means it is operating at full efficiency.

Similarly, we could execute **run_example.sh** without passing arguments to it by creating temporary environment variables for mojo pipeline file and example csv file paths.

```java
export MOJO_PIPELINE_FILE="$HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo”
export EXAMPLE_CSV_FILE="$HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/example.csv”
```
Then try executing **run_example.sh** and you should get similar results as above.

```java
bash run_example.sh
```

Likewise, we can also execute the **ExecuteMojo** Java application directly as below and get similar results as above:

```java
java -Dai.h2o.mojos.runtime.license.key=$DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY -cp mojo2-runtime.jar ai.h2o.mojos.ExecuteMojo $MOJO_PIPELINE_FILE $EXAMPLE_CSV_FILE
```

### Batch Scoring via Run PySparkling Program

Start PySparkling to enter PySpark interactive terminal:

```java
cd $HOME/sparkling-water-3.30.0.6-1-3.0
./bin/pysparkling --jars $DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY
```

![batch-scoring-via-pysparkling-program-1](assets/batch-scoring-via-pysparkling-program-1.jpg)

Now that we are in the PySpark interactive terminal, we will import some dependencies:

```java
# First, specify the dependency
import os.path
from pysparkling.ml import H2OMOJOPipelineModel, H2OMOJOSettings
```

We configure the H2O MOJO Settings to ensure the output columns are named properly and then load the MOJO scoring pipeline:

```java
# The 'namedMojoOutputColumns' option ensures the output columns are named properly.
settings = H2OMOJOSettings(namedMojoOutputColumns = True)
homePath = os.path.expanduser("~")
```

```java
# Load the pipeline. 'settings' is an optional argument.
mojo = H2OMOJOPipelineModel.createFromMojo(homePath + "/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo", settings)
```
Next load the example csv data as Spark’s DataFrame

```java
# Load the data as Spark's Data Frame
dataFrame = spark.read.csv(homePath + "/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/example.csv", header=True)
```

Finally, we will run batch scoring on the Spark DataFrame using mojo transform and get the scored data for the hydraulic cool condition:

```java
# Run the predictions. The predictions contain all the original columns plus the predictions added as new columns
predictions = mojo.transform(dataFrame)

# Get the predictions for desired cols using array with selected col names
predictions.select([mojo.selectPredictionUDF("cool_cond_y.3"), mojo.selectPredictionUDF("cool_cond_y.20"), mojo.selectPredictionUDF("cool_cond_y.100")]).collect()
```

![batch-scoring-via-pysparkling-program-2](assets/batch-scoring-via-pysparkling-program-2.jpg)

```java
# Quit PySparkling
quit()
```

The MOJO predicted the Hydraulic System cooling condition for each row within the batch of Hydraulic System test data we passed to it. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency and 100 means it is operating at full efficiency.

So that is how you execute the MOJO scoring pipeline to do batch scoring using PySparkling.

### Batch Scoring via Run Sparkling Water Program

Start Sparkling Water to enter Spark interactive terminal:

```java
cd $HOME/sparkling-water-3.30.0.6-1-3.0
./bin/sparkling-shell --jars $DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY
```
![batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-1](assets/batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-1.jpg)

![batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-2](assets/batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-2.jpg)

Now that we are in the Spark interactive terminal, we will import some dependencies:

```java
// First, specify the dependency
import ai.h2o.sparkling.ml.models.{H2OMOJOPipelineModel, H2OMOJOSettings}
```

We configure the H2O MOJO Settings to ensure the output columns are named properly and then load the MOJO scoring pipeline:

```java
// The 'namedMojoOutputColumns' option ensures the output columns are named properly.
val settings = H2OMOJOSettings(namedMojoOutputColumns = true)

val homePath = sys.env(”HOME”)
```

```java
// Load the pipeline. 'settings' is an optional argument.
val mojo = H2OMOJOPipelineModel.createFromMojo(homePath + "/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo", settings)
```

Next load the example csv data as Spark’s DataFrame

```java
// Load the data as Spark's Data Frame
val dataFrame = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv(homePath + "/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/example.csv")
```

Finally, we will run batch scoring on the Spark DataFrame using mojo transform and get the scored data for cool efficiency:

```java
// Run the predictions. The predictions contain all the original columns plus the predictions
// added as new columns
val predictions = mojo.transform(dataFrame)

# Get the predictions for desired cols sep by comma with selected col names
predictions.select(mojo.selectPredictionUDF("cool_cond_y.3"), mojo.selectPredictionUDF("cool_cond_y.20"), mojo.selectPredictionUDF("cool_cond_y.100")).show()
```
![batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-3](assets/batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-3.jpg)

```java
# Quit Sparkling Water
:quit
```

The MOJO predicted the Hydraulic System cooling condition for each row within the batch of Hydraulic System test data we passed to it. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency and 100 means it is operating at full efficiency.

So that is how you execute the MOJO scoring pipeline to do batch scoring using Sparkling Water.

## Task 4: Interactive Scoring

The mojo can also predict a Hydraulic System cooling condition for each individual Hydraulic System row of test data. You will build a Java program, PySparkling, and Sparkling Water program to execute the mojo to do interactive scoring on individual Hydraulic System rows.

### Interactive Scoring via Run Custom Java Program

Create a **MojoDeployment** folder and go into it:

```java
cd $HOME/dai-mojo-java/apps/
mkdir MojoDeployment
cd MojoDeployment
```

Make sure the java runtime file mojo2-runtime.jar and pipeline.mojo is located in this folder:

```java
cp $HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/mojo2-runtime.jar .
cp $HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo .
```

In the H2O documentation [Driverless AI MOJO Scoring Pipeline - Java Runtime](http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/scoring-mojo-scoring-pipeline.html), they give us a Java code example to predict a CAPSULE value from an individual row of data, we need to modify this code for our Hydraulic System data. Create a Java file called **ExecuteDaiMojo.java**.

Based on our Hydraulic System **example.csv** data, we can take the header row and a row of data to replace the data in rowBuilder in the Java code example. So, the Java code example becomes:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
 
import ai.h2o.mojos.runtime.MojoPipeline;
import ai.h2o.mojos.runtime.frame.MojoFrame;
import ai.h2o.mojos.runtime.frame.MojoFrameBuilder;
import ai.h2o.mojos.runtime.frame.MojoRowBuilder;
import ai.h2o.mojos.runtime.utils.SimpleCSV;
import ai.h2o.mojos.runtime.lic.LicenseException;
 
public class ExecuteDaiMojo {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, LicenseException {
   // Load model and csv
   String homePath = System.getProperty("user.home");
   MojoPipeline model = MojoPipeline.loadFrom(homePath + "/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo");
 
   // Get and fill the input columns
   MojoFrameBuilder frameBuilder = model.getInputFrameBuilder();
   MojoRowBuilder rowBuilder = frameBuilder.getMojoRowBuilder();
 
   rowBuilder.setValue("psa_bar", "155.6405792236328");
   rowBuilder.setValue("psb_bar", "104.91106414794922");
   rowBuilder.setValue("psc_bar", "0.862698495388031");
   rowBuilder.setValue("psd_bar", "0.00021100000594742596");
   rowBuilder.setValue("pse_bar", "8.370246887207031");
   rowBuilder.setValue("psf_bar", "8.327606201171875");
   rowBuilder.setValue("motor_power_watt", "2161.530029296875");
   rowBuilder.setValue("fsa_vol_flow", "2.0297765731811523");
   rowBuilder.setValue("fsb_vol_flow", "8.869428634643555");
   rowBuilder.setValue("tsa_temp", "35.32681655883789");
   rowBuilder.setValue("tsb_temp", "40.87480163574219");
   rowBuilder.setValue("tsc_temp", "38.30345153808594");
   rowBuilder.setValue("tsd_temp", "30.47344970703125");
   rowBuilder.setValue("pump_eff", "2367.347900390625");
   rowBuilder.setValue("vs_vib", "0.5243666768074036");
   rowBuilder.setValue("cool_eff_pct", "27.3796");
   rowBuilder.setValue("cool_pwr_kw", "1.3104666471481323");
   rowBuilder.setValue("eff_fact_pct", "29.127466201782227");
   frameBuilder.addRow(rowBuilder);
 
   // Create a frame which can be transformed by MOJO pipeline
   MojoFrame iframe = frameBuilder.toMojoFrame();
 
   // Transform input frame by MOJO pipeline
   MojoFrame oframe = model.transform(iframe);
   // `MojoFrame.debug()` can be used to view the contents of a Frame
   // oframe.debug();
 
   // Output prediction as CSV
   SimpleCSV outCsv = SimpleCSV.read(oframe);
   outCsv.write(System.out);
 }
}
```

Now we have our ExecuteDaiMojo.java code, so let’s compile it:

```java
javac -cp mojo2-runtime.jar -J-Xms2g ExecuteDaiMojo.java
```

ExecuteDaiMojo.class is generated. Run the this Java program to execute the MOJO:

```java
java -Dai.h2o.mojos.runtime.license.file=$DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY -cp .:mojo2-runtime.jar ExecuteDaiMojo
```

**Note**: Windows users run

```java
java -Dai.h2o.mojos.runtime.license.file=license.sig -cp .;mojo2-runtime.jar ExecuteDaiMojo
```

![interactive-scoring-via-custom-java-program-1](assets/interactive-scoring-via-custom-java-program-1.jpg)

The MOJO predicted the cooling condition for the individual row of Hydraulic System test data we passed to it. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency and 100 means it is operating at full efficiency.

So that is how you execute the MOJO scoring pipeline to do interactive scoring using Java directly.

## Task 5: Challenge

### Execute Scoring Pipeline for a New Dataset

There are various challenges one could do, you could do something that helps you in your daily life or job. Maybe there is a dataset you are working with, you could reproduce the steps we did above, but for your dataset, build a new experiment and execute your MOJO scoring pipeline to do batch scoring or interactive scoring.

### Embed Scoring Pipeline into Existing Program

Another challenge could be to use the existing MOJO scoring pipeline we executed and instead of using the examples we shared above, integrate the scoring pipeline into an existing Java, Python or Scala program.
