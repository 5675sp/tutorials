## Objective
**Machine Learning Model Deployment** is the process of making your model available in production environments, so they can be used to make predictions for other software systems [1]. Before model deployment, **feature engineering** occurs in the form of preparing data that later on will be used to train a model [2]. Driverless AI **Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)** combines the best feature engineering and one or more **machine learning models** into a scoring pipeline [3][4]. The **scoring pipeline** is used to score or predict data when given new test data [5]. The scoring pipeline comes in two flavors. The first scoring pipeline is a **Model Object, Optimized(MOJO) Scoring Pipeline,** which is a standalone, low-latency model object designed to be easily embeddable in production environments. The second scoring pipeline is a Python Scoring Pipeline, which has a heavy footprint that is all Python and uses the latest libraries of Driverless AI to allow for executing custom scoring recipes[6].

By the end of this tutorial, you will predict the **cooling condition** for a **Hydraulic System Test Rig** by deploying an **embeddable Python Scoring Pipeline** into **Python Runtime** using **Python**. The Hydraulic System Test Rig data comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems#). Hydraulic System Test Rigs are used to test components in Aircraft Equipment, Ministry of Defense, Automotive Applications, and more [7]. This Hydraulic Test Rig is capable of testing a range of flow rates that can achieve different pressures with the ability to heat and cool to simulate testing under different conditions [8]. Testing the pressure, volume flow and temperature is possible by Hydraulic Test Rig sensors and digital displays. The display panel alerts the user when certain testing criteria is met displaying either a green/red light [8]. A filter blockage panel indicator is integrated into the panel to ensure the Hydraulic Test Rigâ€™s oil is maintained [8]. The cooling filtration solution is designed to minimize power consumption and expand the life of the Hydraulic Test Rig. We are predicting cooling conditions for Hydraulic System Predictive Maintenance. When the cooling condition is low, our prediction tells us that the cooling of the Hydraulic System is close to total failure and we may need to look into replacing the cooling filtration solution soon.

The Hydraulic Test Rig consists of a primary and secondary cooling filtration circuit with pumps that deliver flow and pressure to the oil tank. The oil tank box at the bottom. There is a pressure relief control valve for controlling the rising and falling flows. There is a pressure gauge for measuring the pressure.

## Task 1: Set Up Environment

### Launch AWS EC2 Instance

We will launch an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS AMI that is a t2.2xlarge instance with 256GB storage and open ports for ssh at 22 and custom tcp at 9090. When we are about to launch the system, we will create a key pair to access this system.

Login to your AWS Management Console using your AWS account root user credentials: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home

Search for EC2 service and click it in the dropdown:

![search-for-ec2-service](assets/search-for-ec2-service.jpg)

On the page that appears, in the left side bar, click Instances. Then click **Launch Instance.**

![launch-instance](assets/launch-instance.jpg)

Choose AMI: **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type.** Click **Select.**

![choose-ubuntu-1804-ami](assets/choose-ubuntu-1804-ami.jpg)

Choose **t2.2xlarge** instance. Then click **Next: Configure Instance Details.**

![choose-t2-2xlarge-instance](assets/choose-t2-2xlarge-instance.jpg)

For **Configure Instance Details**, keep them default. Then click **Next: Add Storage.**

Set the Storage to **256 GB** size or less for Root General Purpose SSD (gp2). Then click **Next: Add Tags.**

![set-storage-256-gb](assets/set-storage-256-gb.jpg)


Set the **Key** as **Model Deployment** and **Value** as **Driverless AI Python Scoring Pipeline.** Then click **Next: Configure Security Group.**

![set-tags](assets/set-tags.jpg)


Open ports for **ssh at 22** and **custom tcp at 9090.** Then click **Review and Launch.** 

![open-ssh-tcp-ports](assets/open-ssh-tcp-ports.jpg)

When you are ready click **Launch.** A window will appear asking you to select an existing key pair or create a new key pair. Choose **Create a new key pair.** Name it **ec2-model-deployment.** Then click **Download Key Pair.** 

![create-ec2-key-pair](assets/create-ec2-key-pair.jpg)

The **Launch Instances** will be highlighted. Click it. You should see your **Launch Status:**

![ec2-launch-status](assets/ec2-launch-status.jpg)

Click on the instance that is launching in the green box above. You should see your EC2 instance state go from pending to running.

![ec2-instance-running](assets/ec2-instance-running.jpg)


Keep a copy of your **EC2 Public DNS** and remember the file path to your **Private Key File ec2-model-deployment.pem.** We will use this information to securely SSH into our EC2 instance.

### Connect to the EC2 Instance
On your local machine, move the **EC2 Private Key File** to the .ssh folder:

```
# Move Private Key to .ssh folder
mv $HOME/Downloads/ec2-model-deployment.pem $HOME/.ssh/

# Set Private Key permissions to 400 to avoid SSH permission denied
chmod 400 $HOME/.ssh/ec2-model-deployment.pem
```

Depending on your OS, run one of the following set of commands to **add a permanent environment variable** for your **EC2 Public DNS** and **EC2 Private Key:**

```
# Add permanent environment variables on Mac OS X
tee -a $HOME/.bash_profile << EOF
export H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE=<EC2 Public DNS>.compute.amazon.com
export H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM=$HOME/.ssh/ec2-model-deployment.pem
EOF
source $HOME/.bash_profile

# Add permanent environment variables on Linux
tee -a $HOME/.profile << EOF
export H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE=<EC2 Public DNS>.compute.amazon.com
export H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM=$HOME/.ssh/ec2-model-deployment.pem
EOF
source $HOME/.profile
```

Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH:

```
# Connect to EC2 instance using SSH
ssh -i $H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM ubuntu@$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE
```

After connecting to your EC2 instance, your terminal should look as follows:

![ssh-into-ec2](assets/ssh-into-ec2.jpg)

### Set the Driverless AI License Key in EC2 Instance

While connected to the EC2 instance, set the Driverless AI License Key as a permanent environment variable, so you can use the Python scoring pipeline. This is the same license key you used in Driverless AI to train the model.

```
# Set Driverless AI License Key
echo "export DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY='<license-key>'" | tee -a $HOME/.profile
source $HOME/.profile
```

### Install the Requirements in EC2 Instance
We will install the required packages on our EC2 instance:

```
# Install the Requirements
# Make all packages available on EC2 instance
sudo apt-get -y update

# Install Python 3.6 and related packages
sudo apt-get -y install python3.6 python-virtualenv python3.6-dev python3-pip python3-dev python3-virtualenv

# Install OpenBLAS for linear algebra calculations
sudo apt-get -y install libopenblas-dev

# Install Unzip for access to individual files in scoring pipeline folder
sudo apt-get -y install unzip

# Install Java to include open source H2O-3 algorithms
sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk

# Install tree for displaying environment directory structure
sudo apt-get -y install tree

# Install the thrift-compiler
sudo apt-get install automake bison flex g++ git libevent-dev \
  libssl-dev libtool make pkg-config libboost-all-dev ant
wget https://github.com/apache/thrift/archive/0.10.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf 0.10.0.tar.gz
cd thrift-0.10.0
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

# Refresh runtime after installing thrift
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
```

### Create Environment Directory Structure in EC2 Instance

Next, we recommend you create the following environment directory structure in your EC2 instance since it will make it easier to follow along with the rest of the tutorial. Run the following commands:

```
# Create directory structure for model deployment projects (covers MOJO and Python)
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/common/license
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/testData/{test-batch-data,test-real-time-data}
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/{mojo-scoring-pipeline/{java-runtime/java/mojo2-java-runtime,cpp-runtime/{c/mojo2-c-runtime/{linux,macos-x,ibm-powerpc},r-wrapper/mojo2-r-runtime/{linux,macos-x,ibm-powerpc},python-wrapper/mojo2-py-runtime/{linux,macos-x,ibm-powerpc}}},python-scoring-pipeline}
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/apps
tree model-deployment
```
![env-dir-structure-ubuntu](assets/env-dir-structure-ubuntu.jpg)

Now we have the environment directory structure built. Next, we will connect to a Driverless AI EC2 instance to download a python scoring pipeline built for the Hydraulic sensor data.

### Download Python Scoring Pipeline to Local Machine
If you have not built the experiment, go to [Tutorial 4A: Scoring Pipeline Deployment Introduction](https://training.h2o.ai/products/tutorial-4a-scoring-pipeline-deployment-introduction) to build it. When finished, come back to this tutorial.

Now that the experiment is built, click **Download Python Scoring Pipeline** to download it to your local machine.
![download-python-scoring-pipeline](assets/download-python-scoring-pipeline.jpg)

### Move Local Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 Instance
The Python Scoring Pipeline scorer.zip was downloaded to the Downloads folder on the local machine. We need to move it to our EC2 instance. Open a new terminal on your local machine, then run the following command:

```
# Move Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 instance
scp -i $H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM $HOME/Downloads/scorer.zip ubuntu@$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:/home/ubuntu
```

It may take up to 7 minutes for the transfer to complete.

![move-py-scoring-pipeline-to-ec2](assets/move-py-scoring-pipeline-to-ec2.jpg)

Go to the terminal in which you are already connected to your EC2 instance. Move the **scorer.zip** file to `python-scoring-pipeline/` folder and then extract it:

```
cd $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/python-scoring-pipeline/
mv $HOME/scorer.zip .
unzip scorer.zip
```

### Create Virtual Environments in EC2 Instance
In your EC2 instance, create four virtual environments: **env, http_server_env** and **tcp_server_env, tcp_client_env.** Then install all of the required libraries. Any time we wish to run one of our python scripts **example.py, http_server.py, tcp_server.py, custom_tcp_client.py,** we will activate the appropriate environment.

```
# Change to scoring-pipeline folder, Create virtual environments in it
cd scoring-pipeline

# Create virtual environment example env and install required libraries
virtualenv -p python3.6 env
source env/bin/activate
# Install gitdb2 and gitdb into env
pip install --upgrade gitdb2==2.0.6 gitdb==0.6.4
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
 
# Create virtual environment http_server_env and install required libraries
virtualenv -p python3.6 http_server_env
source http_server_env/bin/activate
# Install gitdb2 and gitdb into env
pip install --upgrade gitdb2==2.0.6 gitdb==0.6.4
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install server dependencies
pip install -r http_server_requirements.txt
deactivate
 
# Create virtual environment tcp_server_env and install required libraries
virtualenv -p python3.6 tcp_server_env
source tcp_server_env/bin/activate
# Install gitdb2 and gitdb into env
pip install --upgrade gitdb2==2.0.6 gitdb==0.6.4
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install server dependencies
pip install -r tcp_server_requirements.txt
deactivate

# Create virtual environment tcp_client_env and install required libraries
virtualenv -p python3.6 tcp_client_env
source tcp_client_env/bin/activate
# Install client dependencies
pip install -r client_requirements.txt
deactivate
```
**Note:** You may see h2o specific error messages during the install process, this is okay and the install will still be successful.

```
ERROR: h2o4gpu 0.3.2+master.65994f3 has requirement python-dateutil==2.7.2, but you'll have python-dateutil 2.8.1 which is incompatible.

```

With the environment setup for the Python Scoring Pipeline, we are ready to classify for the Hydraulic System cooling condition from Hydraulic test data, but first we will focus on learning the Python Scoring Pipeline concepts.

## Task 2: Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline Concepts

### Python Scoring Pipeline Files

After downloading the Python Scoring Pipeline, the **scoring-pipeline** folder comes with many files. The wheel file that is needed to execute the Python Scoring Pipeline is the **scoring_h2oai_experiment_6a77d0a4_6a25_11ea_becf_0242ac110002-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl**, which is a library that we use to import the **Scorer** from. The **Scorer** is a class we use to do interactive or batch scoring on data. There are Python scripts that help with executing the scoring pipeline directly in Python, on an HTTP server and on a TCP server. They include **example.py,** **http_server.py,** and **tcp_server.py.** In the Python Scoring Pipeline, we have an HTTP scoring service and a TCP scoring service. These two scoring services are independent and mutually exclusive.

### Embedding Python Scoring Pipeline into Python Runtime

To run the Python **example.py** script, there is the helper shell script **run_example.sh.** When the Python **example.py** is executed, it executes the Python scoring pipeline directly in Python and does various types of scoring on the test data. The Python **example.py** does interactive scoring in which it uses **scorer.score([...])** method to score one row at a time. Additionally, the Python **example.py** does batch scoring in which it uses **scorer.score_batch(dataframe** or **datatable)** to score a frame of data. A frame one can think of as a batch of rows. Batch scoring is faster than interactive scoring. The Python **example.py** does batch scoring on a Pandas dataframe and a Datatable. In the Datatable part of the Python **example.py,** Datatable saves the initial test data into a **test.csv** and saves the predictions into a **preds.csv.** To help in interpreting the modelâ€™s predictions for individual observations (rows) and batches of observations (frames), the Python **example.py** also obtains per-feature prediction contributions per row and per frame by setting the **pred_contribs** flag to **True** in the **scorer.score([...], pred_contribs=True).** The Python **example.py** also performs feature transformations without scoring to enrich the dataset by using **Scorer.fit_transform_batch()** to fit the feature engineering pipeline on the given training frame, validation frame and optionally on the test frame.

### Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline to a Server via Scoring Service

#### Scoring Pipeline Deployment To an HTTP Server

The HTTP scoring service has 2 functions: start the HTTP scoring service and get prediction results back by giving it data. To start the HTTP scoring service, run the Python **http_server.py** by executing the helper shell script **run_http_server.sh.** To use the HTTP scoring service to send data and get predictions results back over **JSON-RPC 2.0 calls**, run the helper shell script **run_http_client.sh**. When the **http_server.py** is executed, it deploys the Python scoring pipeline on an HTTP server, which makes the scoring pipelineâ€™s modules available to be called through remote procedure calls (RPC). Once the JSON-RPC 2.0 call powered by Tornado is made by the client, data is sent to the HTTP server with a request for the Python scorer to make predictions on the data using **scorer.score()** method. Then the prediction results are returned back to the client. Predictions can be made on individual rows (row-by-row) known as interactive scoring or on frames (multiple rows) known as batch scoring.

#### Scoring Pipeline Deployment To a TCP Server

The TCP scoring service has 2 functions: start the scoring TCP scoring service and get prediction results back by giving it data. The TCP scoring service provides high-performance RPC calls by way of Apache Thrift using a binary wire protocol. To start the TCP scoring service, run the Python **tcp_server.py** by executing the helper shell script **run_tcp_server.sh**. To use the TCP scoring service to send data and get prediction results over high-performance RPC calls, run the helper shell script **run_tcp_client.sh**. When the **tcp_server.py** is executed, it deploys the Python scoring pipeline on a TCP server, which makes the scoring pipelineâ€™s modules available to be called through remote procedure calls (RPC). Once the RPC call powered by the thrift and h2oai_scoring libraries is made by the client, data is sent to the TCP server with a request for the Python scorer to make predictions on the data using the **scorer.score()** method. Then the prediction results are returned back to the client. Then the prediction results are returned back to the client. Predictions can be made on individual rows (row-by-row) known as interactive scoring or on frames (multiple rows) known as batch scoring.

## Task 3: Interactive and Batch Scoring via Embedded Deployment

You will execute the Python Scoring Pipeline using Python directly, HTTP scoring service and TCP scoring service to do batch scoring and interactive scoring on data.

### Interactive and Batch Scoring via Run Python Example

You will run the **example.py** script that came with the scoring-pipeline folder. This script uses the Python scorer to do interactive scoring using scorer.score(row) and batch scoring using scorer.score_batch(frame) for the Hydraulic System cooling condition on the Hydraulic sensor data. Additionally, this script also transforms a dataset by fitting the feature engineering pipeline on the data and gets per-feature prediction contributions also known as shapley values.

Since we already set our Driverless AI license key as an environment variable in our EC2 instance, we can run **example.py**:

```
# Activate virtual environment env to run python example.py
source env/bin/activate
python example.py
deactivate
```

Output should be similar to the following, but columns and predictions will match the data in your scoring pipeline:

![scoring-data-example-py-1](assets/scoring-data-example-py-1.jpg)
![scoring-data-example-py-2](assets/scoring-data-example-py-2.jpg)
![scoring-data-example-py-3](assets/scoring-data-example-py-3.jpg)

**Note:** in the above image, some of the transformed frames were cutoff.

## Task 4: Interactive and Batch Scoring via Server Deployment

### Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 HTTP Server

To deploy the Python Scoring Pipeline to the EC2 HTTP server, run the following command to start the HTTP server and execute the Python Scoring Pipeline on it:

```
# Activates http_server_env, starts HTTP server and executes Python Scoring
# Pipeline on it, deactivates virtual environment when stopping server
bash run_http_server.sh
```
![run-http-server-sh](assets/run-http-server-sh.jpg)

### Get Predictions using Local HTTP Client

Now the HTTP scoring service is listening on port 9090, we will use an HTTP client local to the HTTP server to get predictions. In the Python Scoring Pipeline folder, we will use **run_http_client.sh**, which executes multiple example json requests for interactive scoring (individual rows), batch scoring (multiple rows), getting input columns, transformed columns and target labels. 
 
Open another terminal to connect to your EC2 instance, then we will navigate to the **scoring-pipeline** folder and then execute the script **run_http_client.sh**:
 
```
# Change to scoring-pipeline folder
cd $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/python-scoring-pipeline/scoring-pipeline
bash run_http_client.sh
```

Output should be similar to the following, but the Hydraulic System cooling condition classification shown in the json responses will match the data in your scoring pipeline:

![http-client-get-scores](assets/http-client-get-scores.jpg)

This classification output is the interactive and batch scoring done for our Hydraulic System cooling condition. You should receive classification probabilities for `cool_cond_y.3`, `cool_cond_y.20`, `cool_cond_y.100`. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency and 100 means it is operating at full efficiency.

### Get Predictions using Remote HTTP Client
Alternatively, we will use a remote HTTP client to connect to the HTTP server on port 9090 to get a prediction, feature column names and shapley values from the Python Scoring Pipeline. 
 
Letâ€™s use the remote HTTP client to do interactive scoring, so we will get the classification for the Hydraulic System cooling condition for an individual row. Open another terminal from your local machine, run the following command:

```
curl http://$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:9090/rpc --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data @- <<EOF
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "score",
  "params": {
    "row": {
      "psa_bar": "155.86865234375",
      "psb_bar": "104.91106414794922",
      "psc_bar": "1.0658478736877441",
      "psd_bar": "0.0",
      "pse_bar": "8.370246887207031",
      "psf_bar": "8.321526527404785",
      "fsa_vol_flow": "2.018571615219116",
      "fsb_vol_flow": "8.87533187866211",
      "tsa_temp": "35.32476806640625",
      "tsb_temp": "40.96274948120117",
      "tsc_temp": "38.30345153808594",
      "tsd_temp": "30.426250457763672",
      "pump_eff": "2369.710693359375",
      "vs_vib": "0.5306166410446167",
      "cool_pwr_pct": "1.1132166385650635",
      "eff_fact_pct": "29.071916580200195"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```
Output should show a score for the Hydraulic System cooling condition of an individual row.

![remote-http-client-get-scores-1](assets/remote-http-client-get-scores-1.jpg)
 
Next we will use the remote HTTP client to get feature column names for an individual row, so when we retrieve shapley values, we know which value is which column. Run the following command from your local machine:

```
echo "Get the transformed columns"
curl http://$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:9090/rpc --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data @- <<EOF
{
 "id":1,
 "method":"get_transformed_column_names",
 "params":{}
}
EOF
```

Output should show the featured column names for an individual row.

![remote-http-client-get-scores-2](assets/remote-http-client-get-scores-2.jpg)


We will use the remote HTTP client to get shapley values (also known as per-feature prediction contributions) from an individual row. This call is the same as we did for getting a prediction on an individual row, but this time we include the parameter `"pred_contribs": true`. Run the following command from your local machine:
 
```
curl http://$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:9090/rpc --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data @- <<EOF
{
 "id": 2,
 "method": "score",
 "params": {

      "psd_bar": "2.350000067963265e-05",
      "pse_bar": "8.367691993713379",
      "psf_bar": "8.322537422180176",
      "fsa_vol_flow": "2.0297765731811523",

You just learned how to perform interactive scoring and batch scoring using the HTTP scoring service. Next we will deploy the Python Scoring Pipeline to a TCP server that will run on our EC2 instance. So, go to your terminal where your HTTP server is running on EC2, then press control + C to stop the HTTP server.

### Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 TCP Server

To deploy the Python Scoring Pipeline to the EC2 TCP server, go to the terminal that was running the HTTP server on your EC2 instance, run the following command to generate the Thrift bindings once, start the TCP server and execute the Python Scoring Pipeline on it:

```
# Activates tcp_server_env, starts TCP server and executes Python Scoring
# Pipeline on it, deactivates virtual environment when stopping server
bash run_tcp_server.sh
```

### Get Predictions using Local TCP Client

Now the TCP scoring service is listening on port 9090, we will use a TCP client local to the TCP server to get predictions. In the Python Scoring Pipeline folder, we will create a **custom_tcp_client.py**, which uses **thrift** and **h2oai_scoring** libraries to enable the TCP client to use the Python **scorer** methods through the TCP scoring service. 
 
With the **TCP client** having access to the **scorer** methods, we will use the **client.score(row)** method to do interactive scoring, **client.get_column_names()** to get input columns, the **client.get_transformed_column_names()** to get feature column names and **client.get_target_labels()** to get target labels. 

Go to the terminal where you ran your local HTTP client on your EC2 instance, run the following command to create the **custom_tcp_client.py** script:
```
cd $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/python-scoring-pipeline/scoring-pipeline
tee -a custom_tcp_client.py << EOF

sys.path.append('gen-py')

row1.effFactPct = float('29.071916580200195')  # eff_fact_pct
score1 = client.score(row1, pred_contribs=False, output_margin=False)
print(score1)
 
print('Retrieve column names')
print(client.get_column_names())
 
print('Retrieve transformed column names')
print(client.get_transformed_column_names())
 
transport.close()
EOF
```

Execute the python script, so the TCP client local to the TCP server will get predictions for the Hydraulic System cooling condition:

```
# Activate virtual environment env to run python example.py
source tcp_client_env/bin/activate
python custom_tcp_client.py
deactivate
```

Output should be similar to the following, but columns and predictions will match the data in your scoring pipeline:

## Task 5: Challenge

### Execute Scoring Pipeline for a New Dataset

There are various challenges one could do, you could do something that helps you in your daily life or job. Maybe there is a dataset you are working with, you could reproduce the steps we did above, but for your dataset, build a new experiment and execute your Python scoring pipeline to do batch scoring or interactive scoring.

### Embed Scoring Pipeline into Existing Program

Another challenge could be to use the existing Python scoring pipeline we executed and instead of using the examples we shared above, integrate the scoring pipeline into an existing Java, Python or C++ program using the TCP or HTTP scoring service.

## Next Steps

- Scoring Pipeline Deployment in C++ (Coming soon...)
- Scoring Pipeline Deployment in Java Runtime (Coming soon)
- Scoring Pipeline Deployment to Apache NiFi (Coming soon...)
