# Contribute Tutorial Updates

## Introduction

If you're looking to contribute a new tutorial, you've come to the right place! A contribution could be as small as fixing typos and broken links, or as large as adding or editing entire sections.

## Prerequisites
- Experience with Github. If you need a guide, check out Appendix A: New To Github? to get up to speed.

## Outline

- [Create A New Issue]()
- [Fork The Repository And Make Changes]()
- [Make A Pull Request]()
- [Appendix A: New To Github?]()

## Create A New Issue

To make the community aware of the changes you plan on making, please create a new issue and outline what you'll be working on.

## Fork The Repository And Make Changes

**Fork** the repository and make all changes on your forked repository.

As you make updates to existing tutorials (fix bugs, add enhancements, update component versions), verify that your updates satisfy this contributor checklist:

 - Issue created, specifying the tutorial needing updating and the proposed changes
 - All tutorial assets (images, files, etc.) stored in the tutorials' assets folder
 - **Github issue referenced** in your commit message

## Make A Pull Request

Once the checklist above is satisfied, [make a pull request](https://github.com/h2oai/tutorials/pulls). A repository committer will then review your changes and the new tutorial will go live!
